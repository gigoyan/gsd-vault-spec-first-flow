description: Onboard an existing repository into the Codex-native GSD workflow by inspecting the actual codebase and producing a grounded architecture map and initial planning state. Use when a repo already contains code but lacks a trustworthy CODEBASE_MAP.md or workflow artifacts.

# GSD Map Codebase

Create a factual repository map before milestone planning starts.
Use this skill to inspect structure, commands, dependencies, conventions, and hotspots without inventing unsupported architecture claims.

## Workflow
1. Classify the intake using [`.planning/templates/intake-routing-and-evidence-contract.md`](../../../.planning/templates/intake-routing-and-evidence-contract.md). Use this skill for `existing_project_mapping` and for `partial_maturity_continuation` cases that need factual repo grounding.
2. Inspect the repository layout, entrypoints, manifests, scripts, major modules, and test setup.
3. Identify build, test, lint, and run commands from repo evidence.
4. Summarize the actual architecture, conventions, and risk areas in [`.planning/CODEBASE_MAP.md`](../../../.planning/CODEBASE_MAP.md).
5. Track mapping conclusions as `Confirmed`, `Suggested`, or `Unknown`. Treat observable repo structure, commands, manifests, and explicit user confirmations as `Confirmed`; keep forward-looking interpretations, likely milestone candidates, and recommended next steps as `Suggested`; keep unresolved or conflicting areas as `Unknown`.
6. Backfill [PROJECT.md](../../../PROJECT.md) and [`.planning/STATE.md`](../../../.planning/STATE.md) minimally if they are missing or placeholder-only, including whether the repo expects a project-local vault arrangement.
7. Assess whether the current project already has a sufficiently current Project Idea Document and enough preliminary technical direction grounded in repo evidence and explicit user input to reach stack-selection readiness. If either is missing, stale, or materially underspecified, stop short of stack selection and milestone planning and route explicitly to the prerequisite artifact work first.
8. Treat `$gsd-select-stack` as the next step after stack-selection readiness. Do not infer stack decisions beyond what the repository already proves.
9. Record whether a project-local vault scaffold already exists, should be verified, or should be created through `gsd-vault-bootstrap`.
10. Distinguish lightweight mapping from serious deep-mapping intent before finalizing the output. Treat repo onboarding, current-state orientation, and fast factual discovery as lightweight mapping. Treat modernization, major refactor, version upgrade, platform migration, stack migration, or other transformation-oriented understanding as serious deep mapping.
11. For lightweight mapping, keep the output concise and factual. For serious deep-mapping intent, preserve the same factual grounding but route to the dedicated [`.agents/skills/gsd-deep-map-codebase/SKILL.md`](../../../.agents/skills/gsd-deep-map-codebase/SKILL.md) workflow so the output expands into transformation-ready boundaries, blockers, seams, and handoff guidance instead of collapsing into a thin summary.
12. Recommend likely first milestone candidates only when the governing Project Idea Document and Technical Specification are sufficiently current; otherwise recommend the missing readiness work instead. Do not create milestone files unless explicitly asked to switch into milestone planning.

## Source Templates
- [`.planning/templates/codebase-map-template.md`](../../../.planning/templates/codebase-map-template.md)
- [`.planning/templates/project-template.md`](../../../.planning/templates/project-template.md)
- [`.planning/templates/project-idea-document-template.md`](../../../.planning/templates/project-idea-document-template.md)
- [`.planning/templates/technical-specification-template.md`](../../../.planning/templates/technical-specification-template.md)
- [`.planning/templates/stack-selection-and-configuration-package-template.md`](../../../.planning/templates/stack-selection-and-configuration-package-template.md)

## Required Outputs
- [`.planning/CODEBASE_MAP.md`](../../../.planning/CODEBASE_MAP.md): architecture summary, key paths, commands, conventions, risks, and any future-facing interpretations with `Confirmed`, `Suggested`, and `Unknown` kept visibly separate when the template supports it.
- [PROJECT.md](../../../PROJECT.md): minimal project charter if still missing or placeholder-only.
- Readiness assessment: whether the current project's Project Idea Document, preliminary technical direction, Technical Specification, and stack-selection/configuration-package planning artifacts are sufficiently current for the next step, or which prerequisite artifact work or `$gsd-select-stack` handoff must happen next.
- Vault bootstrap note: whether a project-local vault scaffold exists or the next explicit `gsd-vault-bootstrap` handoff is needed.
- Serious-mapping boundary: when transformation-oriented intent is present, the mapping output must say that lightweight mapping is no longer sufficient, preserve the deep-mapping goal explicitly, and point to the dedicated deep-mapping workflow rather than pretending the onboarding pass already planned the transformation.
- [`.planning/STATE.md`](../../../.planning/STATE.md): status updated to reflect mapping completion, milestone and phase status as `none` unless active work already exists, durable-memory follow-up as `none`, and the next recommended action as either prerequisite spec-readiness work or `$gsd-plan-milestone` only when the governing artifacts are sufficiently current.

## Rules
- Prefer repo evidence over assumptions. If something is unclear, mark it as unknown rather than guessing.
- Use the shared `Confirmed` / `Suggested` / `Unknown` evidence meanings and keep them stable across outputs.
- Keep modernization ideas, probable subsystem boundaries, and likely first-milestone candidates framed as `Suggested` unless the repo or user explicitly confirms them.
- Keep conflicting or missing repo understanding visible as `Unknown` rather than smoothing it into a neat architecture summary.
- Cite real paths and commands. Avoid hand-wavy summaries.
- If the repository is effectively empty, stop and switch to `$gsd-new-project`.
- Exception: if the user explicitly asks to select the stack, allow `$gsd-select-stack` to gather missing stack-selection inputs directly instead of forcing a detour through `$gsd-new-project` first.
- Map repo reality first, then route the current project through Project Idea Document and Technical Specification backfill if needed. Do not pretend milestone planning is valid without those artifacts.
- Use UI options whenever remaining user input can reasonably be expressed as structured choices or confirmations.
- Do not treat serious deep-mapping intent as a lightweight mapping request.
- When deep-mapping intent is present, keep the mapping output factual and transformation-ready. Capture subsystem boundaries, dependency seams, integration hotspots, blockers, and migration-sensitive constraints, but do not turn the skill into migration design, architecture redesign, or execution planning.
- When the user needs serious deep mapping, do not stop at "the repo probably needs a milestone." Produce an exact handoff that names `$gsd-plan-milestone` as the next GSD action, frames the next milestone as a large structured mapping milestone, and gives the next session a prompt specific enough to continue without guessing.
- Keep written normalization lightweight by default. Only require a fuller written normalization pass when ambiguity, risk, scope, or explicit user request justifies it.
- Do not write durable project memory from mapping. The only vault action allowed here is identifying or handing off project-local scaffold verification.
- Do not create milestone or phase files here. Mapping is preparation for planning, not planning itself.

## Completion Check
- [`.planning/CODEBASE_MAP.md`](../../../.planning/CODEBASE_MAP.md) is grounded in observable repository facts.
- [`.planning/STATE.md`](../../../.planning/STATE.md) names the next recommended action.
- The output identifies at least one plausible first milestone candidate only when the governing Project Idea Document and Technical Specification are sufficiently current; otherwise it explicitly routes to the missing readiness work without pretending planning is already done.
