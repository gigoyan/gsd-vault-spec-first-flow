# GSD Generate Runtime Adapters

Generate runtime-specific project-local outputs from the current stack-selection/configuration-package artifact and the selected stack profile output manifest.

Use this skill after stack selection is current. Do not use it to choose the stack, change reusable stack-profile truth, update export behavior, or verify a phase.

## Supported Runtime Targets

- `codex`
- `claude_code`
- `both`

`both` expands to `codex` and `claude_code`.

## Workflow

1. Read [PROJECT.md](../../../PROJECT.md), [`.planning/STATE.md`](../../../.planning/STATE.md), the current stack-selection/configuration-package artifact, and [`.planning/templates/agent-runtime-adapter-contract.md`](../../../.planning/templates/agent-runtime-adapter-contract.md).
2. Read the selected stack profile metadata and output manifest. For the Node.js backend service profile, start with [`.agents/stack-profiles/backend/nodejs-service/assets/output-manifest.toml`](../../../.agents/stack-profiles/backend/nodejs-service/assets/output-manifest.toml).
3. Resolve target runtime(s) from the stack-selection artifact, the user request, or an explicit script argument. Accept only `codex`, `claude_code`, or `both`. Keep `Confirmed`, `Suggested`, and `Unknown` meanings intact:
   - `Confirmed`: explicit user choice, current artifact decision, or repo-proven fact.
   - `Suggested`: profile-backed recommendation that still needs acceptance.
   - `Unknown`: missing or conflicting decision; stop and ask for confirmation before writing outputs.
4. Run a dry run first and inspect the created/updated/skipped report. Do not write generated runtime outputs until target runtimes, selected profile, output root, and preservation behavior are clear.
5. Generate only project-local runtime adapter outputs:
   - Codex: `.codex/config.toml` and `.codex/agents/*.toml` from the selected profile templates and output-manifest mappings.
   - Claude Code: `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/agents/*.md`, and `.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md` from selected profile templates plus canonical `.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md` projection rules.
6. Preserve project-owned files and managed blocks:
   - Do not overwrite existing generated runtime files by default when content differs.
   - Report existing different files as `skipped` unless the user explicitly approves replacement.
   - Treat `.codex/**` and generated `.claude/**` as project-local runtime outputs, not blueprint truth.
7. Do not generate root `CLAUDE.md` from stack profile data. `CLAUDE.md` remains governed by the global bootstrap-then-managed-block adapter rule established in the root Claude Code adapter phase.
8. Report all outputs as `created`, `updated`, or `skipped`, with a short reason for each skipped file.
9. If validation uses a temporary output root, remove or ignore that temporary root before handoff. Do not leave generated `.codex/**` or `.claude/**` changes in the repository unless the user explicitly requested generation into the project.

## Scripted Projection

Use the deterministic helper when available:

```powershell
python .agents\skills\gsd-generate-runtime-adapters\scripts\generate_runtime_adapters.py --target both --dry-run
```

Useful arguments:

- `--target codex|claude_code|both`
- `--profile-assets <path>` defaults to `.agents/stack-profiles/backend/nodejs-service/assets`
- `--output-root <path>` defaults to the repository root
- `--selection-file <path>` reads simple stack-selection values when present
- `--var key=value` supplies explicit render values for template placeholders
- `--force` allows updating existing generated files whose content differs
- `--dry-run` reports without writing files
- `--json` emits a machine-readable report

Run target validation without leaving generated runtime output changes in the repository by using a temporary output root:

```powershell
$tmp = Join-Path $env:TEMP "gsd-runtime-adapters-codex"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $tmp -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
python .agents\skills\gsd-generate-runtime-adapters\scripts\generate_runtime_adapters.py --target codex --output-root $tmp --var http_framework=fastify
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $tmp -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Repeat for `claude_code` and `both` when validating this workflow.

## Claude Skill Projection Rules

Source:

```text
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Target:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Projection rules:

- Preserve the core workflow content.
- Normalize legacy workflow-name phrases to `GSD coding-agent workflow`.
- Normalize generic Codex child-agent tool-name prohibitions to the runtime-neutral delegation rule.
- Do not copy `.agents/skills/**/agents/openai.yaml`.
- Add Claude Code frontmatter to the projected skill.
- Add `disable-model-invocation: true` for high-risk generated skills:
  - `gsd-sync-blueprint`
  - `gsd-export-blueprint-package`
  - `gsd-export-project-context`

High-risk frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: Audit, export, or synchronize GSD workflow assets. Invoke explicitly only.
disable-model-invocation: true
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, Edit, Write
---
```

Normal projected frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: <runtime-neutral skill purpose>
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, Edit, Write
---
```

Read-only projected skills may use:

```yaml
---
description: <runtime-neutral skill purpose>
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash
---
```

## Rules

- Generate only project-local runtime adapter outputs.
- Do not classify generated `.codex/**` or generated `.claude/**` as blueprint truth.
- Do not update `AGENTS.md`, root `CLAUDE.md`, export scripts, project-context export files, sync/distribution contracts, flattened generated export files, or vault notes from this skill.
- Do not generate runtime outputs during stack selection; this workflow is the bounded follow-on.
- Stop instead of guessing when target runtime, selected profile, or material stack-selection values remain `Unknown`.
- Preserve existing project-owned runtime files unless replacement was explicitly approved.

## Completion Check

- Target runtime(s) were resolved as `codex`, `claude_code`, or `both`.
- The selected stack profile output manifest was read.
- A dry-run report was reviewed before writing to the project root.
- Generated outputs were limited to project-local runtime adapter paths.
- Existing project-owned runtime files and managed blocks were preserved or explicitly approved for update.
- The report lists created, updated, and skipped outputs.
- Root `CLAUDE.md` was not generated from stack profile data.
