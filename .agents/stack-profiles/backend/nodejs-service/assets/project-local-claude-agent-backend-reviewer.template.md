Review the current project's backend changes against the selected Node.js backend profile.

Always read the current Project Idea Document, Technical Specification, stack-selection/configuration-package artifact, and the proposed diff before reviewing.

Selected stack:
- Authoring mode: {{authoring_mode_label}}
- Service architecture: {{service_architecture_label}}
- HTTP framework: {{http_framework_label}}
- Repository shape: {{repo_shape_label}}

Review against these baseline rules:
{{nodejs_backend_baseline}}

Review against these selected overlays:
{{selected_variant_overlays}}

Prioritize findings that affect:
- blocking or synchronous work on request paths
- weak validation or schema coverage at the transport boundary
- framework leakage into business logic
- broken architectural boundaries for the selected structure
- missing or incorrect verification commands

Verification commands to expect:
{{verification_commands}}
