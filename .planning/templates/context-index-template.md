# Context Index Template

Use this template for `.planning/CONTEXT_INDEX.md`.
This artifact is the primary coding-agent navigation guide for a repository. It is not a full architecture document, not durable vault memory, and not a replacement for source inspection.

Keep it compact, task-routing oriented, and evidence-based. Prefer paths, symbols, canonical examples, commands, validation routes, and do-not-touch boundaries over narrative explanation.

## Purpose
- Help coding agents choose the smallest useful context for a task.
- Tell planning, execution, verification, quick-task, mapping, and milestone orchestration skills where to start.
- Capture how agents should work safely in this repo.
- Reduce repeated repository discovery.
- Keep repository navigation guidance repo-local and evidence-based.

- Staleness triggers:
  - major folder restructuring
  - new module, service, package, or app boundary
  - changed build/test/lint/run commands
  - changed framework/runtime/tooling
  - changed validation strategy
  - changed architecture or dependency direction
  - changed runtime, data, persistence, or integration behavior
  - repeated agent over-scanning in the same area
  - failed task because routing guidance was missing or wrong

## Agent Editing Contract
- Start from the matching task-routing row before broad search.
- Inspect the `Start here` paths before `Then inspect` paths.
- Copy canonical examples before inventing new syntax, naming, error-handling, validation, or test patterns.
- Verify important routing claims against source files before changing behavior.
- Prefer targeted validation from the matching row or module card before broader checks.
- Avoid generated, vendor, cache, build-output, unrelated, and fragile areas unless the task explicitly requires them.
- If a route is missing, stale, or contradicted by actual work, update this file when the correction is small and directly evidenced.
- If the needed correction is broad or uncertain, record a precise `$gsd-map-codebase` unified mapping refresh candidate in `.planning/STATE.md`.
- Do not use this file to bypass active milestone, phase, specification, acceptance, or verification criteria.
- Do not store this file or its contents in the Obsidian vault.

## Change Impact Routing

| Change observed | Required routing artifact action | Evidence status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Module ownership/path changes | Update the matching `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` task row and module card. | Unknown |
| Validation command changes | Update the validation matrix and update `.planning/tool-capabilities.md` if a command failed due to environment/tool availability. | Unknown |
| Architecture or dependency direction changes | Update `.planning/CODEBASE_MAP.md`. | Unknown |
| Runtime, data, persistence, or integration behavior changes | Update `.planning/CODEBASE_MAP.md`. | Unknown |
| Reusable implementation pattern changes | Update the matching `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` convention card and record a `gsd-session-save` candidate in `.planning/STATE.md` when the pattern has durable reuse value. | Unknown |
| Durable decision or debugging insight emerges | Record a `gsd-session-save` candidate in `.planning/STATE.md`; do not write vault memory from planning, execution, verification, quick-task, or mapping unless the session-save skill is explicitly invoked. | Unknown |
| Route is missing, stale, or misleading | Update `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` when local and evidence-supported, otherwise record a precise `$gsd-map-codebase` unified mapping refresh candidate in `.planning/STATE.md`. | Unknown |

## Do-Not-Scan Boundaries
- Do not inspect generated files unless the task concerns generated output or build artifacts.
- Do not inspect vendor, dependency, cache, or build-output folders unless the task explicitly concerns those areas.
- Do not inspect unrelated frontend areas for backend-only tasks unless the API contract or user-facing behavior requires it.
- Do not inspect unrelated backend areas for UI-only tasks unless data contracts, permissions, or integration behavior require it.
- Do not run full-suite validation before targeted validation unless the phase, milestone, or repo convention requires it.

## GSD Infrastructure Boundary
- In normal application repositories, treat `.agents/skills/**`, `.planning/templates/**`, `.gsd/**`, and reusable GSD docs as workflow infrastructure, not application code.
- Do not route application implementation tasks into GSD infrastructure files unless the task explicitly concerns GSD itself.
- If the active task is to update GSD itself, switch routing to blueprint-maintenance mode and use the blueprint manifest.

## Tool Capability Notes
- Before running repository commands, check `.planning/tool-capabilities.md` if it exists.
- If a command is recorded as blocked, unavailable, non-executable, incompatible, or unsafe, use the approved fallback.
- If a new command fails because of environment/tool availability, record the failure once in `.planning/tool-capabilities.md` with the approved fallback.
