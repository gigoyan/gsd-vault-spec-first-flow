# Stack Profile And Variant Option Contract

Use this contract to define reusable stack-aware blueprint data after the current project has completed:
- Project Idea Document
- stack-selection readiness

This contract exists so the reusable GSD package can hold curated stack guidance without shipping project-specific runtime outputs.

## Design Basis
- Put durable project guidance in runtime instruction surfaces:
  - Codex: `AGENTS.md`
  - Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md`
- Put repeatable task workflows in skills.
- Keep skills narrowly scoped because runtime skill discovery depends on concise descriptions.
- Put project-local runtime/tool configuration in runtime adapter outputs:
  - Codex: `.codex/config.toml`, `.codex/agents/*.toml`
  - Claude Code: `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/skills/**`
- If project-local runtime adapter outputs are required for the current project and the repository does not yet contain the target runtime directory, create it inside that project's local runtime copy at generation time.
- Do not use generated runtime adapter files as the source of truth for user-facing conversation-language policy; that policy is defined in project instruction surfaces.
- Use tools and MCP only when they materially improve the workflow and are supported by the selected runtime.
- Keep the reusable blueprint generic. Generate project-local runtime adapter outputs only after the current project has selected a stack, variants, and target runtime(s).

## Contract Goals
- Capture enough information to generate stack-aware project instructions, skills, and project-local runtime adapter configuration.
- Separate reusable blueprint truth from project-specific selections.
- Support multiple valid patterns for one stack through explicit variant options.
- Support profile-backed `Suggested` defaults, recommended option combinations, and convention bundles without silently promoting them to `Confirmed`.
- Make non-technical selection possible by requiring plain-language explanations, fit guidance, tradeoffs, and examples.
- Keep official-doc freshness review and project-local output generation as explicit follow-on work after selection capture instead of blurring them into the active selection step.

## Storage Rules
- Store reusable stack profiles and variant options in the blueprint, not in project state files.
- Store project-specific selections in the current project's spec artifacts and stack-selection artifact.
- Store generated project-local runtime adapter files only in the current project's local runtime copy after selection is complete.
- Generated runtime adapter files must not become reusable stack-profile truth.
- Do not store stack profile data in the vault unless the project itself has a durable project-specific decision worth saving there.

## Stack Profile Contract
Each supported stack profile must define the fields below.

### Identity
- `profile_id`: Stable machine-readable identifier such as `backend-nodejs-express`.
- `display_name`: User-facing name.
- `domain`: One of `frontend`, `backend`, `data`, `auth`, `integration`, `hosting`, `observability`, or another explicit stack domain used by the blueprint.
- `status`: `active`, `experimental`, `deprecated`, or `archived`.

- `summary`: One-paragraph plain-language description of what this profile represents.

### Ownership And Freshness
- `owners`: Maintainer names or team.
- `last_reviewed`: Date the profile was last manually reviewed.
- `freshness_policy`:

  - `priority`: `primary`, `secondary`, or another explicit ranking label used only to order `Suggested` recommendations.
  - `when_to_suggest`: Repo-proven facts, explicit user inputs, or project conditions that justify surfacing this bundle as a `Suggested` recommendation.
  - `not_when`: Evidence or constraints that suppress this bundle even if it would otherwise be a fit.
  - `rationale`: Why this recommendation is a fit for the matching conditions.
  - `tradeoffs`: Main costs or constraints the user should understand before accepting it.
  - `suggested_convention_ids`: Convention bundle IDs that should be shown with the recommendation.

- `prerequisites`: Requirements before this option is valid.
- `incompatible_with`: Other option IDs or profile IDs that conflict with this option.
- `follow_up_questions`: Extra questions triggered only when this option is selected.

### Traceability
- `source_refs`: Official or approved secondary references for this option.
- `last_reviewed`: Date the option guidance was last checked.

## Selection Flow Rules
- Run stack-profile selection only after the Project Idea Document is current and the project has reached stack-selection readiness.
- The Technical Specification may still be draft or partial at first-time stack selection if the current project already has enough problem, flow, constraint, and architecture-direction clarity to make deliberate stack choices.
- If the user explicitly asks to select the stack before those artifacts exist, gather the minimum missing stack-selection inputs inline and let stack selection proceed as part of Spec-First instead of blocking on bootstrap artifacts.
- Use structured choice UI when available so the user can choose among curated options.
- Surface profile-backed recommendation sets, recommended option combinations, and convention overlays as visibly `Suggested`; do not silently convert them to `Confirmed`.
- When the user accepts or overrides a recommendation set, capture that decision explicitly in the project stack-selection artifact.
- Every option shown to the user must include:
  - short description
  - best-fit guidance
  - main tradeoff
- Include an example when the option would be materially easier to understand with one.
- Keep examples short in the selection UI. Longer examples belong in supporting text or references.
- For existing projects, map repo reality first and ask only for missing or future-target choices.
- For new projects, ask the minimum stack and variant questions needed to produce a coherent stack-selection artifact and then route back to finish the stack-aware Technical Specification before milestone planning or project-local generation when needed.

## Deferred Follow-On Rules
- Treat the curated stack profile as the primary blueprint source of truth during active stack selection.
- Do not pull narrow official-doc freshness review into the active recommendation-capture step unless a later bounded phase explicitly takes ownership.
- Do not let ad hoc web research silently rewrite the reusable profile.
- If the project later runs a bounded freshness review and finds a material conflict:
  - adjust only the later project-local outputs when the change is low-risk and clearly supported by official docs, or
  - flag the reusable profile for maintainer review when the change would alter blueprint truth.

## Mapping Rules
- Reusable stack profile data belongs in the blueprint.
- Selected profile IDs and selected option IDs belong in the current project's stack-selection artifact.
- The project's Project Idea Document and Technical Specification should record only project-relevant reasoning and architecture decisions, not the full reusable profile payload.
- Generated runtime instruction, skill, agent, and configuration outputs should be derived outputs, not the canonical source of stack truth.

## Minimum Project Artifact Capture
When a project selects a stack profile and variant options, capture at least:
- selected `profile_id`
- selected `version`
- selected `axis_id` to `option_id` mappings
- target runtime(s): `codex`, `claude_code`, or `both`
- primary runtime, when one is preferred
- runtime adapter outputs requested
- runtime-specific constraints or disabled outputs
- why each selected option fits the current project
- profile-backed recommendation sets reviewed, accepted, declined, or deferred
- convention overlays shown or accepted
- explicit override decisions and why they were made
- any deferred freshness or project-local-generation follow-up noted at selection time
- any project-local deviations from the curated profile

## Recommended Authoring Pattern
- Start with a small set of officially supported stack profiles.
- Give each profile only the variant axes that genuinely matter for project shape, code conventions, or agent behavior.
- Prefer one focused skill per recurring workflow instead of one broad skill per entire stack.
- Keep generated instruction outputs concise and behavioral.
- Keep long rationale, examples, and references in skill docs or profile references rather than bloating generated instructions.

## Suggested Future Layout
If the blueprint later adds a stack catalog, use a structure like:

```text
.agents/
  stack-profiles/
    backend/
      nodejs-express/
        profile.toml
        references/
        assets/
        skills/
    frontend/
      nextjs/
        profile.toml
        references/
        assets/
        skills/
```

The exact storage format can be TOML, YAML, or Markdown frontmatter-backed docs, but the contract fields above must remain representable without ambiguity.
